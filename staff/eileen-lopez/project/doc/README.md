# App

## Intro

EyeCandy is an intuitive, ready to use tool, mainly aimed at web and other kinds of app designers. Its main purpose aims to facilitate color picking for UIs.

EyeCandy offers a simple color gradient of your color of choice, and then presents different color combinations to suit the user's preference: Complimentary, split complimentary, triadic and tetradic.
Within the web app, people will be able to visualize their ideas in real time with a miniature example that includes main UI elements such as headers, footers, navigation bars, buttons, textboxes and more.

Users are then encouraged to log into the app to save and share their color palettes, and see other users' suggestions if they struggle to find inspiration. These shared palettes will have a point ranking system, pushing the best ranked to the top of the "user's choice", a small section within the main tool's webpage to showcase them.
